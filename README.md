ESPM 288 (Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science) at the University of California, Berkeley emphasizes the practice of reproducibility within the fields of data science and environmental sciences. Programming languages used throughout the course include R and Python and were used to produce problem-driven analyses using different types of data (e.g. raster, vector, etc.). The final project aims to incorporate different visualizations using the 10m Annual Land Use Land Cover (9-class) V2 data from the Microsoft Planetary Computer datasets (https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-lulc-annual-v02).
